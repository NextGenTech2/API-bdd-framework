Welcome to the API Automation team! This document serves as a guide to understand the architecture, standards, and best practices for our API testing framework.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
*   **Language**: Java
*   **BDD Framework**: Cucumber
*   **HTTP Client**: RestAssured
*   **Test Runner**: TestNG (with Surefire Parallel Execution)
*   **JSON Processing**: `org.json` & `JsonPath`

## 📂 Project Structure

Our framework is cleanly separated into main framework code and test execution code:

```text

│   │   ├── models/       # POJOs for Requests and Responses (ApiResponse, RequestBuilder)
│   │   ├── services/     # ApiService.java (Prepares request specs, URLs, and executes via RestClient)
│   │   └── utils/        # Core utilities: ApiConfig, AuthManager, ResponseValidator, ScenarioContext
│   ├── steps/            # Hooks.java & ApiSteps.java (Cucumber Step Definitions)

├── src/main/resources/
│   ├── payloads/         # payloads.json (Centralized test data / JSON bodies)
│   └── schemas/          # JSON Schema files for endpoint validation
├── src/test/java/com/example/
│   └── runners/          # ApiRunnerTest.java (TestNG runner used to test the framework)
└── src/test/resources/
    └── features/         # Cucumber .feature files used for testing the framework
```

## 🏗️ Core Architecture Patterns

### 1. State Management (`ScenarioContext.java`)
Cucumber creates a new instance of step definition classes for every scenario. To safely share data between `@Given`, `@When`, and `@Then` steps without using static variables (which break parallel execution), we use **`ScenarioContext`**. It internally utilizes `ThreadLocal` to store context data for the current executing thread safely.
*   *Examples*: Saving an endpoint, an extracted auth token from a login response, or a newly created resource ID (`noteId`) to be used in subsequent steps.

### 2. Payload Management (`payloads.json`)
To keep our `.feature` files readable, we strictly **do not** write inline JSON strings. Instead, all request payloads are stored in `src/main/resources/payloads/payloads.json` as key-value pairs.
Our framework also supports two powerful dynamic data features:
*   **Dynamic Value Generation**: Placeholders like `{{random.email}}` or `{{random.name}}` in your `payloads.json` file will be automatically replaced with unique generated data for each test run.
*   **Payload Parameterization**: You can override values in a template payload directly from your feature file using a `DataTable`, which is perfect for data-driven testing.

### 3. Assertions (`ResponseValidator.java`)
All assertions regarding status codes and response bodies are centralized in the `ResponseValidator` class to maintain consistency and provide unified error messages across all tests.

### 4. Schema Validation
API Contracts are verified via `JsonSchemaValidator`. You can add `And the response body should match the JSON schema "my_schema.json"` to your features to strictly check data types and required fields against schema files stored in `src/main/resources/schemas/`.

### 5. Parallel Execution
The framework leverages TestNG and Maven Surefire to run tests in parallel. Scenarios run concurrently to increase execution speed. Do not use static variables in steps or helpers to ensure thread-safety.
*   **To disable parallelism temporarily (e.g., for debugging):** Run tests with `mvn clean test -Ddataproviderthreadcount=1`.
*   **To disable parallelism permanently:** Set `@DataProvider(parallel = false)` in `ApiRunnerTest.java`.

## 🚀 How to Automate an End-to-End Scenario

When adding new tests, follow these steps to maintain standards:

### Step 1: Add Test Data to `payloads.json`
If your API request requires a body (POST/PUT/PATCH), open `payloads.json` and add a new JSON object with a descriptive key. You can use placeholders for dynamic data.
```json
"user_registration": {
  "name": "{{random.name}}",
  "email": "{{random.email}}",
  "password": "Tester123"
},
"note_template": {
  "title": "{{title}}",
  "description": "{{description}}",
  "category": "{{category}}"
}
```

### Step 2: Write the Feature File
Create or update a `.feature` file in `src/test/resources/features/`. Use our highly reusable predefined step definitions so you rarely need to write new Java code.

```gherkin
@users @Positive
Scenario: Successfully create a new user
  Given the API endpoint is "/users"
  And the request body is from the file "payloads/payloads.json" with the key "create_user_success"
  When the client sends a POST request
  Then the response status code should be 201
  And the response body should match the following details:
    | name     | job               |
    | Jane Doe | Software Engineer |
```

### Step 3: Run and Verify
Run the scenario using your IDE or via Maven/Gradle using the tag (e.g., `@users`). If it passes, a detailed HTML report will be generated in `target/cucumber-reports/`.

## 📖 Standard Step Definitions Reference

Here is a cheat sheet of the available steps mapped in `ApiSteps.java`:

### Preparation Steps (`@Given`, `@And`)
*   `Given the API endpoint is "{endpoint}"`
*   `And the request body is from the file "{filePath}" with the key "{key}"`
*   `And the path parameters are:` (Accepts a DataTable)
*   `And the query parameters are:` (Accepts a DataTable)

### Execution Steps (`@When`)
*   `When the client sends a GET request`
*   `When the client sends a POST request`
*   `When the client sends a PUT request`
*   `When the client sends a PATCH request`
*   `When the client sends a DELETE request`

### Validation Steps (`@Then`, `@And`)
*   `Then the response status code should be {int}`
*   `And the response body should contain "{text}"`
*   `And the response body should match the following details:`
    *(Accepts a DataTable. Smartly matches keys for JSON Objects `[0]` vs Lists)*
*   `And the response array should contain the following items:`
    *(Accepts a DataTable list of elements to search for in a JSON Array)*
*   `And the response body should match the JSON schema "{schemaFileName}"`
    *(Validates response body against a JSON schema file located in `src/main/resources/schemas/`)*

### Authentication & Chaining Steps
*   `And the client extracts the "{jsonKey}" from the response as a Bearer token`
    *(Saves the extracted token in memory for the current scenario)*
*   `And the client sets the Bearer token in the header`
    *(Injects the previously saved token into the next request)*
*   `And the client sets an invalid Bearer token in the header`

## 🛡️ Coding Standards & Best Practices

1.  **Do not hardcode URLs in Step Definitions or Feature Files.**
    *   Base URLs belong in `ApiConfig.java` (or properties files). Feature files should only contain relative endpoints (e.g., `/auth/login`).
2.  **Avoid writing new step definitions if an existing one works.**
    *   Reuse generic steps like `the response body should match the following details:` instead of writing specific steps like `the user's name should be Jane`.
3.  **Tagging strategy.**
    *   Use logical tags at the Feature level (e.g., `@auth`, `@products`).
    *   Use status tags at the Scenario level (e.g., `@Positive`, `@Negative`).
4.  **Logging failures.**
    *   `Hooks.java` handles test teardown and automatically prints the failed API response body directly into the Cucumber HTML report for easy debugging. Do not clutter steps with generic `System.out.println()`.
5.  **Always use `ScenarioContext`.**
    *   Never use static variables in `ApiSteps.java` to pass state between steps, as it breaks parallel testing.
